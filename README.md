## Pocketmine Docker Image

Run a [pocketmine server](http://www.pocketmine.net) in no time. This docker file builds the latest __development__ version of Pocketmine. 

Builds will also be tagged with the _build number_ as reported by http://www.pocketmine.net.

### To run a Pocketmine server in a docker container

```bash
docker pull storagenerd1/pocketmine:latest
docker run -d -p 19132:19132 -p 19132:19132/udp --name pocketmine storagenerd1/pocketmine:latest
```

You can now connect to the hosts's IP address (or hostname) at Pocketmine's default port: 19132. Both RCON and game play listen on the same port. RCON on the TCP connection and game play on the UDP connection. 

To verify that the Pocketmine server started you can request the container's logs:

```bash
docker logs pocketmine
```

Here's typical response:

```bash
00:48:17 [INFO] Starting Minecraft: PE server version v0.9.5 alpha
00:48:17 [INFO] Loading pocketmine.yml...
00:48:17 [INFO] Loading server properties...

```

The server starts by default in _survival_ mode and generates a new world.

### Making a RCON connection

To make a RCON connection you'll need to lookup the autogenerated RCON password, which you can find in the `server.properties` file in the container. You can use a 2<up>nd</sup> instance of the `bartt/pocketmine` image to read the `server.properties` file:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --volumes-from pocketmine bartt/pocketmine cat /pocketmine/server.properties
```

Now you can use the reported `rcon.password` to make a RCON connection. For example with [mcrcon](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcrcon/).
